## Usage

To compile and view the default sketch with the
[ClojureScript](https://clojurescript.org/guides/quick-start) compiler:

    $ clojure -M:cljs-repl

The cljs compiler is configured to look for changes in the "src" directory, and will recompile the project on any changes. Refresh the browser after recompilation completes to see those changes reflected in the sketch.

Clean the js output above using:

    $ clojure -T:build clean

Alternatively, use the [Figwheel](https://figwheel.org/) repl for live reload on save after editing any files in `src` or `resources/public/css`:

    $ clojure -M:fig -b dev --repl

Figwheel copies relevant files from resources/public into a target directory with compiled assets in a relative path.

Run the project's tests (they'll fail until you edit them):

    $ clojure -T:build test
