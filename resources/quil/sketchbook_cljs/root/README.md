## Usage

To compile and view the default rotating-ball sketch using [Figwheel](https://figwheel.org/):

    $ clojure -M:fig:repl

Figwheel is a Read-Eval-Print-Loop (REPL) that supports live reload on save after editing any files in the `src` and `resources/public/css` directories and evaluating ClojureScript expressions sent directly from an editor.

After Figwheel downloads the dependencies and compiles the project, it should open a browser tab displaying a canvas with a rotating ball cycling through colors. Try editing `src/{{raw-ns/file}}/rotating_ball.cljs` so that the line with `(q/background 240)` reads `(q/background 0)` and then saving the file. Once the sketch recompiles, the canvas should show a black background instead of the initial gray. After that, experiment with the expressions in the `update-state` function to change the rotation speed, direction or rate of color change.

Figwheel copies relevant files from `resources/public` into a `target` directory with the compiled JavaScript assets in a relative path. 

Alternatively, to compile with the [ClojureScript](https://clojurescript.org/guides/quick-start) compiler directly use:

    $ clojure -M:cljs-repl

This will create `resources/public/js/sketchbook.js` which will display after the sketch after browsing `resources/public/index.html`. To clean this js output above use:

    $ clojure -T:build clean

To run the project's tests in the JVM (they'll fail until you edit them):

    $ clojure -T:build test
